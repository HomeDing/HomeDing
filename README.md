# The HomeDing Library

The The HomeDing Library for Arduino enables building IoT Devices (here called Things in short) using ESP8266 based boards. It is a complete ecosystem of the required internal functionality of a Thing (called the Elements) together with a Web Server implementation that runs a small IDE (Integrated Development Environment) that allows changing and redefining the function of a thing by using a web browser only.
