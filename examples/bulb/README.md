# The bulb example for the HomeDing library

This is an example especially for WiFi bulbs with the ESP8266 processor inside.
These devices only have a small amount of Flash Memory available (1 MByte) for program and web UI storage.

Because thes ressources are limited this sketch only contains Elements that are used within bulbs.
e.g. no sensors.
