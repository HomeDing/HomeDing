# The minimal example for the HomeDing library

This is an example that runs on ESP8266 boards that only have a small amount of Flash Memory available (1 MByte) for program and web UI storage.

This example can be used as a firmware for some socket switches like the [sonoff](/boards/sonoff.md) S20 device. 

Another typical board for this is a [ESP8266-01 board](/boards/esp01) with 1MByte (not 512kByte) Flash Memory.
