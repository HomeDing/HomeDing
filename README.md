## Summary 

The HomeDing library for Arduino enables building IoT devices using ESP8266 based boards.
It is a complete ecosystem of the required internal functionality based on elements that can be activated and integrated by configuration.
It is extensible by adding specific elements.


The embedded Web Server enables controlling the device and linking devices together.

It supports:

* a device specific UI that can be accessed by browsers and mobile devices
* web services using the REST format to control the device
* web services using the REST format to get the status of the device
* retrieving actions from other devices
* a small IDE (Integrated Development Environment) that allows changing the configuration
